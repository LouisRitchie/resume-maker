I completed an 8-month web development co-op working at Ruboss Technology Corporation in December 2016, and I'd love the opportunity to join another software team in 2017. \nI have experience writing software in Javascript/HTML/CSS, Python, Ruby (on or off Rails), Java, Shell, and recently Go. I know React, Webpack, Sass, and other parts of the webdev toolchain. I write code that is easy to read and review and submit good pull requests. I use Linux, Vim, and rely on the command line."
